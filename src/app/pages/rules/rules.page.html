    Team Officials need to pick up player passes after each game from the Field Marshal Tent.
  </p>

  <ion-text>
    <h2>Tie Breakers</h2>
  </ion-text>
  <p>
    In flights where the teams advancing to playoffs are determined by points, a tie will be broken in the following
    order:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Head to Head</b>, winner advancing. If teams played to a draw or teams did not play or a 3-way tie then go to
      the next breaker.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Goals Against</b> with the team giving up the fewest goals advancing. No maximum per
      game. If even then, go to next tie breaker.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Goals Score</b>. The team scoring the most goals advances. A team is credited for each goal up to 3 per game.
      So scoring 8 goals in a game only counts as 3 goals for that game in the tie breaker calculation.
      In 3 games the maximum goals for would be 9 goals. If still tied, go to the next tie breaker.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Shut-out Victories.</b> The team with the most shutout victories will advance. A 0-0 tie does not count as a
      victory
      shutout. If still tied, go to the next breaker.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Goal Differential.</b> Goal Differential is goals scored less goals allowed. Each game has a maximum of 3. A
      6-1
      victory is not different that a 4-1 victory in calculating goal differential. In either case the winning team
      will get a +3 differential (as well as 3 goals towards the goals scored tie breaker).
    </li>
  </ol>

  <ion-text>
    <h2>If Teams are Still Tied</h2>
  </ion-text>
  <p>
    If there are 3 teams tied where there will be a coin toss among the 3 teams with 3 coins, the toss will be repeated
    until there is an odd coin (i.e. 2 heads and 1 tail). The team with the odd coin will receive a bye and the first
    spot shootout will be between the teams with the matching coin. The winner then advancing to play the team with the
    bye. The loser dropping to last among the tied teams. When outcome (i.e. where both teams would advance to a
    semi-final because they tied for first and the second play teams of the group advance to the semi-finals) there
    will be a coin toss to determine the placement. When there are 2 teams tied and only 1 can advance there will be a
    Kicks from the Mark shootout.
  </p>

  <ion-text>
    <h2>Coin Toss for Tie Breakers</h2>
  </ion-text>
  <p>
    The coin toss will be done at the Fort Lowell Headquarters Tent. Teams will be notified but <b>DO NOT</b> have to be
    present. They can be on the phone if they desire. When there are 2 teams involved, the lower number team will be
    heads and the higher number will be tails. So if teams 120 and 123 are tied, 120 will be heads and 123 will be
    tails. The Field Marshal, Head Referee or designated Tournament Official will flip the coin in the absence of the
    teams. A Tournament Official will oversee the coin toss. If there are 3 teams involved, tournament officials will
    represent teams that are not present. The placements will be shown in the standings and schedule.
